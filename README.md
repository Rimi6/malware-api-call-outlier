# Malware API Call Outlier Detection

This code performs outlier detection on a dataset of malware API calls using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. It can help identify unusual or rare API call sequences in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this code is provided in the `sample_analysis_data.csv` file. It contains a list of API calls made by different software samples.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
## 1.Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/Rimi6/malware-api-call-outlier.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash

cd malware-api-call-outlier
```
Run the Python script:
```bash

python api_call_outlier_detection.py
```
## 2.Parameters
You can adjust the following parameters in the code to fine-tune the outlier detection:
- eps: The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered in the same neighborhood. Adjust this to control the density of clusters.
- min_samples: The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. Increasing this can make the algorithm less sensitive to noise but might result in fewer outliers.

## 3.Output
The code will print the following information:

- The count of outliers detected in the dataset.
- Details of the API call sequences classified as outliers.
- Details of the common (non-outlier) API call sequences.
